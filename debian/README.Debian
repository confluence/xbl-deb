xbl for Debian

This game was originally packaged for Debian by Joey Hess from 1996 to 2003, but that package was removed from Debian and Ubuntu around 2005. I have repackaged this using the latest upstream source and some elements of the original package, with updated dependencies and without legacy hacks.
